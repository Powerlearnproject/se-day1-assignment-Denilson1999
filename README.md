#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the process of designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software applications using structured methods and programming principles. It ensures that software is reliable, efficient, and scalable, making it essential for creating the systems and tools that power everything from websites to complex industrial technologies. Its importance lies in driving innovation, improving productivity, and solving real-world problems across industries.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Key milestones in the evolution of software engineering include the development of early programming languages like Fortran and C, which provided the foundation for modern software development by enabling more complex and efficient coding. In the 1960s, software engineering was established as a formal discipline, recognizing the need for structured approaches to manage growing software complexity and improving project outcomes. The rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s marked a shift towards flexible, iterative development processes, enhancing collaboration and responsiveness to change within software projects

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements - This includes gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
Design - The design phase involves the creation of high-level detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
Implementation - This includes the process of writing code and building software according to the design specifications.
Testing - The process of conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
Deployment - This is the process of releasing the software to the end user.
Maintenance - It involves an ongoing process of providing support, updates and enhancements to the software after deployment.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
The Waterfall methodology is a sequential approach where each phase flows in a fixed order, making it ideal for projects with stable, well-defined requirements. Agile, on the other hand, is an iterative, flexible approach focused on collaboration and adapting to changes, making it better suited for dynamic projects like software development. Waterfall works well for projects with predictable outcomes, while Agile thrives in environments that require continuous feedback and adjustments.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
A Software Developer is responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions, turning design specifications into functional software. The Quality Assurance Engineer ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans to identify and resolve defects. The Project Manager oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects, ensuring that timelines, resources, and goals are aligned for successful completion.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) are essential in the software development process as they provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code, improving developer efficiency and productivity (e.g., Visual Studio, Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA). Version Control Systems (VCS), such as Git and SVN, are crucial for tracking changes, managing collaboration, and ensuring that the development process is organized and reversible. Together, IDEs and VCS streamline coding, collaboration, and version management, making them vital for successful software development.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Software engineers often face challenges like changing requirements, tight deadlines, and technical debt. To overcome these, they can use strategies such as effective communication, adopting agile methodologies, prioritizing tasks, and regularly reassessing project goals and timelines to stay on track and maintain quality.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Different types of testing play a crucial role in ensuring software quality. Unit Testing focuses on testing individual components or modules to verify that they work as expected. Integration Testing ensures that different components or subsystems interact correctly when combined. System Testing evaluates the entire software system to ensure it functions as a whole. Lastly, Acceptance Testing checks the software against user requirements to confirm that it meets user needs and expectations, ensuring successful project delivery.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering involves crafting precise and effective input prompts to guide AI models in generating accurate and relevant responses. Its importance lies in ensuring that AI models, like language models, produce useful and contextually appropriate outputs by understanding and interpreting user intent. Effective prompt engineering enhances the quality of AI interactions, making it crucial for applications like automated content generation, chatbots, and data analysis.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
How many athletes in Kenya have won the gold medal?
Using the different olympics held worldwide annually list the names of Kenyan athletes who have won gold since the games were started.
